Numix Bevel Icon Theme
==============
Numix Bevel is the legacy version of Numix Base and Circle, icon themes for Linux. Note that this is not officially supported, though it may recieve occasional updates and new icons. Feel free to contribute to the theme here with your own icons - it's all licensed under GPLv3+. 

### Hardcoded Icons
To deal with hardcoded application icons Numix uses the [hardcode-fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer) script. A list of the applications supported by the script that Numix also covers can be found [here](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/blob/master/data/themes/numix.md).
